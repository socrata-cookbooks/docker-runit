Pull requests are welcome, but may not always be accepted, as this cookbook is
specific to Socrata's usage of Samhain. The better route to add any additional
desired attributes would be to write a Samhain wrapper cookbook of your own.

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Add tests for the new feature; ensure they pass (`rake`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request
